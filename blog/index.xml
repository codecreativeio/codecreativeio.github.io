      <title>Is Service Portal Going Away?</title>

      <description>I really enjoyed Jace Benson&amp;rsquo;s latest post Service Portal is going the way of the mammoth and it&amp;rsquo;s ensuing Twitter conversation. But seeing as how I couldn&amp;rsquo;t answer a yes or no question in 280 characters or whatever it is these days, I certainly can&amp;rsquo;t tackle something of this magnitude&amp;hellip; here we are.
I hope Service Portal does go away
 Truth is, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about this since earlier this summer when people first started asking me about it.</description>

      <description>Hootie captured my current frustrations about time best, I think I&amp;rsquo;m out of my mind / thinking about time. That reference is apparently about 24 years old&amp;hellip; enough time for Hootie to become Darius, cycle through R&amp;amp;B and Country before circling back to the Blowfish he left in the Cracked Rear View so long ago. But that&amp;rsquo;s not the time I&amp;rsquo;m talking about today.
No my friends, today it&amp;rsquo;s all about Time Zones in ServiceNow.</description>

      <description>The following is a summary of the Configuration vs Customization: Which Is It? session that I presented at Knowledge 19.
 The Official Guidance (Slide 1) Intro
&amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t want any customization.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s one of the first things I hear on almost any project. We all know and have been taught that we should avoid ServiceNow customization. The ideal is a purely configured instance. But by day 3 or 4, &amp;ldquo;maybe just this one customization&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Are Extension Points Worth It</title>

      <description>One of the features that most intrigued me in ServiceNow&amp;rsquo;s London release was Extension Points. Unfortunately, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t doing a whole lot of custom app development in London, so that intrigue was left on the bench. Recently, though, I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a little more app development and starting exploring this new feature and finding myself at a cross-roads:
Do I switch to Extension Points or keep using my tried and true methods?</description>

      <title>Service Portal CSS Order of Precedence</title>

      <description>In my work on the Getting Started with Service Portal Guide, I decided to include some information on the order the CSS is processed but truth be told I wasn&amp;rsquo;t 100% certain on it myself. Naturally I hit up the ServiceNow Docs and came across the following image:
  Not Entirely Accurate Hierarchy of style application in the Service Portal   Using that as a basis, I began writing an article on the process.</description>

      <title>Is GlideRecord getValue the King of the String</title>
      <link>https://codecreative.io/blog/is-gliderecord-getvalue-the-king-of-the-string/</link>

      <description>King of the String This article will be long, so here&amp;rsquo;s as quick a synopsis as I can muster. In order to determine if getValue is truly a best practice superior to other GlideRecord field string coercions, I collected and analyzed 278,738 data samples from ServiceNow records in the global scope of a Madrid Personal Developer Instance and compared the resulting types and values of 5 different methods:

      <description>Few things are worse than performing a bulk import of data into ServiceNow only to realize you got something horribly wrong in the Transform Map. With a well planned coalesce, this often won&amp;rsquo;t create an issue since you can just reimport and overwrite. But sometimes things don&amp;rsquo;t go as planned and we need the nuclear option. Up until this point, I am still unaware of any baseline method of rollback for import sets.</description>

      <description>This week I am excited to bring back Michael Green to discuss Nelson Frank&amp;rsquo;s first market trends and salary survey report. Whenever I talk to Michael or his team I end up discussing market trends, which locations are hot for ServiceNow, and how salaries are trending. I love sharing insights with the team at Nelson Frank, especially since most online tools have a hard time differentiating between the general IT market and the ServiceNow niche.</description>

      <description>One month ago, I switched from a MacBook Pro with Touchbar to Surface Book 2. Short of a miracle, I won&amp;rsquo;t likely be going back any time soon.
Why switch? My wife and I have owned Apple devices exclusively since 2012 when she got her first MacBook Pro. Since then, we&amp;rsquo;ve at some point owned pretty much everything: MacBook Air, the new MacBook, MacBook Pro, MacBook Pro with Touchbar, 27&amp;rdquo; iMac, iPads, iPad Pros, iPhones, and heck even our router is the Airport Extreme.</description>

      <description>So once again I am hearing rumors that React may be coming to Service Portal. I know many folks who were upset with the use of AngularJS in Service Portal and even with the general lack of modern frameworks built into ServiceNow. But what if the future was now (thanks to science)?
Well, today I spent some time at lunch exploring that possibility and it turns out React may have been able to work within Service Portal just fine all along.</description>

Hugo, We Go! The first big change of 2019 for CodeCreative was a migration from SquareSpace to a Hugo static site. SquareSpace is great if you use their themes but unfortunately I used a custom theme for CodeCreative.</description>

      <title>Interface Design Patterns: Revealing Module Pattern</title>
      <link>https://codecreative.io/blog/interface-design-patterns-revealing-module-pattern/</link>

      <description>Back to Interface Design Patterns for Script Includes
Introduction The Revealing Module pattern can easily imitate either the Class Pattern or the Namespace Pattern with the added advantage of private state and private functions. This is most helpful in Scoped Applications where the app developer may prefer to keep implementation details hidden while exposing clear public interfaces. But it can also be used to help maintain clear API boundaries over time where traditional Javascript classes and objects would tend towards bloat.</description>

      <title>Interface Design Patterns: Global Include Pattern</title>
      <link>https://codecreative.io/blog/interface-design-patterns-global-include-pattern/</link>

      <description>Back to Interface Design Patterns for Script Includes
Introduction The Global Include pattern is simply a way of running a script file held in a Script Include. It is an odd, powerful, and potentially dangerous tool that allows for many different purposes from leveraging external javascript libraries to importing a collection of functions into the global scope, to monkey patching.
One of the most useful purposes is monkey patching which allows us to modify behaviors of existing Script Includes and even ServiceNow provided classes.</description>

      <title>Interface Design Patterns: Namespace Pattern</title>

      <guid>https://codecreative.io/blog/interface-design-patterns-namespace-pattern/</guid>
      <description>Back to Interface Design Patterns for Script Includes
Introduction The namespace pattern provides a simple mechanism for organizing reusable functions and objects. One of the challenging aspects of using alternative Script Include patterns is that they become harder to identify when used. For example, if I use the Function Pattern in a Business Rule it may be challenging for other developers to quickly identify that getMyTeamMembers() refers to a Script Include instead of a function defined in the script or a Global Business Rule.</description>

      <description>Back to Interface Design Patterns for Script Includes
Introduction The function pattern is the simplest but also the most flexible interface design pattern for Script Includes. It is the foundation for the Revealing Module Pattern and can be used as a constructor or factory function for any of the other interface types. As a factory function, this pattern can provide a Scoped App with a flexible internal API that can easily evolve as complexity increases.</description>

      <description>Back to Interface Design Patterns for Script Includes
Introduction The first interface design pattern for Script Includes that we will take a closer look at is the Class Pattern. The primary use case for this interface pattern is to leverage inheritance&amp;hellip; or more properly prototypal inheritance. Prototypal inheritance will allow a Script Include to inherit behaviors from another. One example of this is Script Includes that inherit from AbstractAjaxProcessor to create Glide Ajax scripts but let&amp;rsquo;s look at a custom application example.</description>

      <description>When I first write a script include to manipulate a GlideRecord, I usually script it to accept a sys_id or other query criteria as a parameter. Its the obvious first step, the GlideRecord has to be retrieved to manipulate it after all. Take this guy for example:
var Test = Class.create(); Test.prototype = { initialize: function() { }, doSomethingAwesome: function(id) { var gr = new GlideRecord(&amp;#39;incident&amp;#39;); if (gr.get()) { // Something awesome gets done here  } }, type: &amp;#39;Test&amp;#39; };  The more I use the script, though, the more likely I am to run into a scenario where I already have the GlideRecord queried from another script.</description>

      <title>A Layman&#39;s Guide to Nested GlideRecords</title>

      <description>My previous articles on the Nested GlideRecord issue were far more technical than I usually try to achieve. After all, if I can&amp;rsquo;t explain it simply enough then I probably don&amp;rsquo;t understand it well myself. With that in mind, I would like to revisit Nested GlideRecords, how they cause performance problems, and why database indexing alone isn&amp;rsquo;t the best solution&amp;hellip; this time with a little more simplicity.
And a parable!</description>

      <title>Avoid the Style Tag in Service Portal Widgets</title>

      <description>Warning: This article is an example of what not to do. Avoid using these practices in your ServiceNow instance.
Previously, we built a widget with configurable CSS styles and I briefly mentioned that using the &amp;lt;style&amp;gt; tag wasn&amp;rsquo;t a great idea. I want to revisit that thought and explore some of the problems that you might encounter when using the &amp;lt;style&amp;gt; tag in a Service Portal Widget. I will use the colored square widget again to demonstrate.</description>

      <description>Note: This article assumes a basic working knowledge of Service Portal Designer, Service Portal Widget development, and the Widget Editor.
In my Service Portal CSS Best Practices post, I mentioned that as widget developers we should avoid hardcoding colors and use CSS variables to allow overriding default styles. Sometimes we want to take this idea to the next level by allowing portal admins to configure the look and feel of widgets without touching code at all.</description>

      <description>When developing Service Portal styles for either the Theme or the Widgets, there is more to think about than there used to be in CMS. Service Portal offers greater modularity to protect our Widgets from our Themes and vice versa. Below are 6 best practices (they&amp;rsquo;re more what you&amp;rsquo;d call guidelines than actual rules) to follow when coding the CSS for your Service Portal to keep your CSS maintainable and flexible.</description>

      <title>GlideRecord Full Text Search Explained</title>

      <description>After posting last week&amp;rsquo;s GlideRecord Full Text Search article using 123TEXTQUERY321, Jeff Pierce reached out and reminded me of a better way of doing it using IR_AND_OR_QUERY. So special thanks to him for helping to clear this up!
I have since updated my previous article to this approach but I wanted to take a moment to dive into the multiple methods of Full Text Search and their differences.
IR_AND_QUERY   IR_AND_QUERY Results   Behind the scenes, the method previously demonstrated (123TEXTQUERY321) behaves in the same way as using IR_AND_QUERY.</description>

      <description>UPDATE: After posting this article, Jeff Pierce reminded me of a better way than the original 123TEXTQUERY321 approach. I have since updated the scripts and article here and provided a deeper explanation in another article.
When looking at the form filters in ServiceNow, I think all admins and developers reach a point where we start to wonder &amp;ldquo;How do I search Keywords in my scripts?&amp;rdquo; After all, that full text search using &amp;ldquo;for text&amp;rdquo; or the &amp;ldquo;Keywords&amp;rdquo; filter is so tantalizing for any custom CMS / Service Portal search feature.</description>

      <description>After my Demystifying GlideAjax infographic I always meant to go back and write a GlideAjax troubleshooting guide. Both troubleshooting my own scripts and helping folks on the ServiceNow Community, I run into the same mistakes over and over and over again. And in spite of making the same mistakes, and eventually stumbling across the same solutions, I&amp;rsquo;ve (shamefully) never quite refined my troubleshooting process on this one. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure if I forget sysparm_name in my Client Script again, ServiceNow is going to send people to my door to reclaim my ServiceNow certificates until I go through remediation training.</description>

      <guid>https://codecreative.io/blog/3-ways-css-widget-scopes-affect-service-portal-css/</guid>
      <description>Previously, we looked at CSS Widget Scopes in Service Portal. This change in how CSS is applied in Service Portal has a few implications for developers that we need to keep in mind when developing widgets and themes.
1. Widget styles are protected from other widget styles This one should go without saying from the previous article but a widget&amp;rsquo;s CSS will only affect widget instances of that type. Each widget has its own prefixed CSS identifier which appears to be the letter &amp;ldquo;v&amp;rdquo; followed by the sys_id of the widget record, in case you are wondering.</description>

      <description>Scoped CSS Screenshot from CanIUse.com   Service Portal as a Content Management System has introduced something that now seems like an obvious oversight in all other CMS applications. In fact, its such a obvious, painful oversight that countless others have attempted some sort of solution. CSS Preprocessors, the HTML5 spec, and the recent CSS and JS specs all introduced scoped concepts such as a scoped attribute, scope pseudo selector, and scoping capability with Shadow DOM most of which was promptly ignored by browsers and removed from spec.</description>

      <description>UPDATE (04/09/2017): This issue appears to be fixed in Istanbul Patch 3
If your organization is using CMS and you are considering upgrading to Istanbul, be on the lookout for a potential issue. Theme CSS styles may not be applied to iFrame content in the CMS for some instances after upgrading to Istanbul. ServiceNow is already looking into the issue so hopefully we will have a resolution soon but I know of a few instances out there that might find this to be a deal breaker for an upgrade so I thought it best to advise the Community.</description>

      <guid>https://codecreative.io/blog/flexbox-layouts-in-service-portal/</guid>
      <description>One of the lesser known features of Service Portal is that you can entirely ditch the Bootstrap grid layout. Technically, this opens up the ability to use Flexbox based layouts. But as some in the Community have found out first hand, using Flexbox as a Bootstrap alternative in Service Portal is not quite as straightforward as it seems.
Most of the &amp;ldquo;problem&amp;rdquo; rests in Flexbox&amp;rsquo;s simplicity. Using only a simple containing div around a set of item divs, Flexbox can achieve many layouts via CSS.</description>

      <description>Previously, I talked about Nested GlideRecords in scripts and the performance impact they can have on your applications. Being able to identify these miscreants is great but we really need to get them out of any mission critical scripts where they are slowing down response times. Here are a couple strategies to kick those GlideRecords out of the nest and to teach them to fly.
1. Array Flattened GlideRecord Normally, in a Nested GlideRecord, you run a GlideRecord query for each record in the result of the first GlideRecord.</description>

      <description>In a troubleshooting conversation with a couple of my teammates, I realized that I take GlideRecord (and its partner GlideAggregate) for granted. When you make that simple gr.query() call, what happens? What SQL does it run? What does the real underlying table structure look like? Are there indexes? Are additional queries run when you dot walk? Does any of this hit a cache? How does the cache work? Where are the optimizations under the hood?</description>

Before we actually dig in and start coding and building portals though, it will help to understand a bit about the components that make up the Service Portal and what they actually do.
Don’t let the Service Portal Configuration link in the application fool you.</description>

Aside from that, Service Portal is truly a much more refined delivery tool for portals and I can’t recommend it highly enough.</description>

In my case, I needed the standard HTML5 doctype.
