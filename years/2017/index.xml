      <description>Back to Interface Design Patterns for Script Includes
Introduction The function pattern is the simplest but also the most flexible interface design pattern for Script Includes. It is the foundation for the Revealing Module Pattern and can be used as a constructor or factory function for any of the other interface types. As a factory function, this pattern can provide a Scoped App with a flexible internal API that can easily evolve as complexity increases.</description>

      <description>Back to Interface Design Patterns for Script Includes
Introduction The first interface design pattern for Script Includes that we will take a closer look at is the Class Pattern. The primary use case for this interface pattern is to leverage inheritance&amp;hellip; or more properly prototypal inheritance. Prototypal inheritance will allow a Script Include to inherit behaviors from another. One example of this is Script Includes that inherit from AbstractAjaxProcessor to create Glide Ajax scripts but let&amp;rsquo;s look at a custom application example.</description>

      <description>Wow, I really left things hanging after the Interface Design Patterns post. The good news is that MapAnything&amp;rsquo;s next release will be amazing! And of course, I will circle back to interface design patterns. But for today, I want to take a look at the start of a library that has been a long time coming.
I love the lodash library. It&amp;rsquo;s great for working with arrays in a simplified manner.</description>

      <guid>https://codecreative.io/blog/eliminate-unnecessary-queries-with-this-simple-check/</guid>
      <description>When I first write a script include to manipulate a GlideRecord, I usually script it to accept a sys_id or other query criteria as a parameter. Its the obvious first step, the GlideRecord has to be retrieved to manipulate it after all. Take this guy for example:
var Test = Class.create(); Test.prototype = { initialize: function() { }, doSomethingAwesome: function(id) { var gr = new GlideRecord(&amp;#39;incident&amp;#39;); if (gr.get()) { // Something awesome gets done here  } }, type: &amp;#39;Test&amp;#39; };  The more I use the script, though, the more likely I am to run into a scenario where I already have the GlideRecord queried from another script.</description>

      <description>My previous articles on the Nested GlideRecord issue were far more technical than I usually try to achieve. After all, if I can&amp;rsquo;t explain it simply enough then I probably don&amp;rsquo;t understand it well myself. With that in mind, I would like to revisit Nested GlideRecords, how they cause performance problems, and why database indexing alone isn&amp;rsquo;t the best solution&amp;hellip; this time with a little more simplicity.
And a parable!</description>

      <title>Avoid the Style Tag in Service Portal Widgets</title>

      <description>Warning: This article is an example of what not to do. Avoid using these practices in your ServiceNow instance.
Previously, we built a widget with configurable CSS styles and I briefly mentioned that using the &amp;lt;style&amp;gt; tag wasn&amp;rsquo;t a great idea. I want to revisit that thought and explore some of the problems that you might encounter when using the &amp;lt;style&amp;gt; tag in a Service Portal Widget. I will use the colored square widget again to demonstrate.</description>

      <description>Note: This article assumes a basic working knowledge of Service Portal Designer, Service Portal Widget development, and the Widget Editor.
In my Service Portal CSS Best Practices post, I mentioned that as widget developers we should avoid hardcoding colors and use CSS variables to allow overriding default styles. Sometimes we want to take this idea to the next level by allowing portal admins to configure the look and feel of widgets without touching code at all.</description>

      <description>When developing Service Portal styles for either the Theme or the Widgets, there is more to think about than there used to be in CMS. Service Portal offers greater modularity to protect our Widgets from our Themes and vice versa. Below are 6 best practices (they&amp;rsquo;re more what you&amp;rsquo;d call guidelines than actual rules) to follow when coding the CSS for your Service Portal to keep your CSS maintainable and flexible.</description>

      <title>GlideRecord Full Text Search Explained</title>

      <description>After posting last week&amp;rsquo;s GlideRecord Full Text Search article using 123TEXTQUERY321, Jeff Pierce reached out and reminded me of a better way of doing it using IR_AND_OR_QUERY. So special thanks to him for helping to clear this up!
I have since updated my previous article to this approach but I wanted to take a moment to dive into the multiple methods of Full Text Search and their differences.
IR_AND_QUERY   IR_AND_QUERY Results   Behind the scenes, the method previously demonstrated (123TEXTQUERY321) behaves in the same way as using IR_AND_QUERY.</description>

      <description>UPDATE: After posting this article, Jeff Pierce reminded me of a better way than the original 123TEXTQUERY321 approach. I have since updated the scripts and article here and provided a deeper explanation in another article.
When looking at the form filters in ServiceNow, I think all admins and developers reach a point where we start to wonder &amp;ldquo;How do I search Keywords in my scripts?&amp;rdquo; After all, that full text search using &amp;ldquo;for text&amp;rdquo; or the &amp;ldquo;Keywords&amp;rdquo; filter is so tantalizing for any custom CMS / Service Portal search feature.</description>

      <description>After my Demystifying GlideAjax infographic I always meant to go back and write a GlideAjax troubleshooting guide. Both troubleshooting my own scripts and helping folks on the ServiceNow Community, I run into the same mistakes over and over and over again. And in spite of making the same mistakes, and eventually stumbling across the same solutions, I&amp;rsquo;ve (shamefully) never quite refined my troubleshooting process on this one. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure if I forget sysparm_name in my Client Script again, ServiceNow is going to send people to my door to reclaim my ServiceNow certificates until I go through remediation training.</description>

      <title>3 Ways CSS Widget Scopes Affect Service Portal CSS</title>

      <guid>https://codecreative.io/blog/3-ways-css-widget-scopes-affect-service-portal-css/</guid>
      <description>Previously, we looked at CSS Widget Scopes in Service Portal. This change in how CSS is applied in Service Portal has a few implications for developers that we need to keep in mind when developing widgets and themes.
1. Widget styles are protected from other widget styles This one should go without saying from the previous article but a widget&amp;rsquo;s CSS will only affect widget instances of that type. Each widget has its own prefixed CSS identifier which appears to be the letter &amp;ldquo;v&amp;rdquo; followed by the sys_id of the widget record, in case you are wondering.</description>

      <description>Scoped CSS Screenshot from CanIUse.com   Service Portal as a Content Management System has introduced something that now seems like an obvious oversight in all other CMS applications. In fact, its such a obvious, painful oversight that countless others have attempted some sort of solution. CSS Preprocessors, the HTML5 spec, and the recent CSS and JS specs all introduced scoped concepts such as a scoped attribute, scope pseudo selector, and scoping capability with Shadow DOM most of which was promptly ignored by browsers and removed from spec.</description>

      <description>UPDATE (04/09/2017): This issue appears to be fixed in Istanbul Patch 3
If your organization is using CMS and you are considering upgrading to Istanbul, be on the lookout for a potential issue. Theme CSS styles may not be applied to iFrame content in the CMS for some instances after upgrading to Istanbul. ServiceNow is already looking into the issue so hopefully we will have a resolution soon but I know of a few instances out there that might find this to be a deal breaker for an upgrade so I thought it best to advise the Community.</description>

      <guid>https://codecreative.io/blog/flexbox-layouts-in-service-portal/</guid>
      <description>One of the lesser known features of Service Portal is that you can entirely ditch the Bootstrap grid layout. Technically, this opens up the ability to use Flexbox based layouts. But as some in the Community have found out first hand, using Flexbox as a Bootstrap alternative in Service Portal is not quite as straightforward as it seems.
Most of the &amp;ldquo;problem&amp;rdquo; rests in Flexbox&amp;rsquo;s simplicity. Using only a simple containing div around a set of item divs, Flexbox can achieve many layouts via CSS.</description>

      <description>Previously, I talked about Nested GlideRecords in scripts and the performance impact they can have on your applications. Being able to identify these miscreants is great but we really need to get them out of any mission critical scripts where they are slowing down response times. Here are a couple strategies to kick those GlideRecords out of the nest and to teach them to fly.
1. Array Flattened GlideRecord Normally, in a Nested GlideRecord, you run a GlideRecord query for each record in the result of the first GlideRecord.</description>

      <description>In a troubleshooting conversation with a couple of my teammates, I realized that I take GlideRecord (and its partner GlideAggregate) for granted. When you make that simple gr.query() call, what happens? What SQL does it run? What does the real underlying table structure look like? Are there indexes? Are additional queries run when you dot walk? Does any of this hit a cache? How does the cache work? Where are the optimizations under the hood?</description>
