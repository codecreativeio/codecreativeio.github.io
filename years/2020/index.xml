      <description>What drives your salary in the ServiceNow industry? Is it the product of some cosmic coincidence? Or is there really a ServiceNow god watching over everything. You know, with a plan for it and stuff. I don&amp;rsquo;t know, man, but it keeps me up at night.
Seriously though. Red vs Blue reference aside, what characteristics influence your worth in the industry? Would you be worth more if you dove into ITBM instead of ITSM?</description>

      <description>The alternate working title of this article was Jace Was Right. In case you missed it over the weekend, I posted the video above to youtube covering the new UX system that powers ServiceNow Workspaces. And according to reliable information, this system will be eventually taking over most, if not all, of the web UI&amp;rsquo;s at ServiceNow including Service Portal. While there is a good chance that Service Portal will still be the primary choice for new end user interfaces for at least the next year, it&amp;rsquo;s worth exploring what this new UX system promises for the future.</description>
