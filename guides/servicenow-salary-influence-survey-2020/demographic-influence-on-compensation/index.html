<p>One repeated comment in the survey feedback was a concern that workers in India were being underpaid for the same skillsets compared to their US counterparts. Not only does this concern seem to have merit but a worker&rsquo;s country of employment appears to have the strongest influence on overall compensation of any variable taken into consideration in this survey.</p>
<p>Survey responses included workers from a wide range of countries which at face value makes a comparison quite difficult. To alleviate these difficulties, reported compensation values were converted from the respondants local currency into International Dollars (GK$) using the Purchasing Power Parity adjustment</p>
